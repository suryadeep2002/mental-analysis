# 🧠 Mental Health Analysis Project (End-to-End EDA)

## 📌 Overview

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being. This project focuses on performing **end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a mental health dataset to identify patterns, trends, and key factors affecting mental well-being across different demographics and work environments.

The goal of this project is to **clean, analyze, and visualize mental health data** to generate meaningful insights that can support awareness, decision-making, and future predictive modeling.

* **Data Type:** survey (CSV)
* **Key Features:**

  * Age
  * Gender
  * Work environment
  * Mental health condition indicators
  * Treatment and support availability
  * Stress and workload factors

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**

   * Import dataset using Pandas
   * Initial inspection of rows, columns, and data types

2. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handling missing values
   * Removing duplicates
   * Fixing inconsistent or incorrect entries
   * Encoding categorical variables (if required)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Univariate analysis

   * Box plots
   * Heatmaps for correlations

5. **Insights & Findings**

   * Identification of high-risk groups
   * Impact of work environment on mental health
   * Relationship between stress, support, and treatment

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* Mental health concerns vary significantly across age groups and work environments
* Workplace support plays a major role in treatment seeking behavior
* Stress levels and workload are strongly correlated with mental health conditions
* Awareness and accessibility of mental health resources remain limited in some groups

---

## 📈 Visualizations

The project includes clear and informative visualizations such as:

* Mental health condition distribution
* Gender-wise and age-wise analysis
* Work environment vs mental health impact
* Correlation heatmaps for feature relationships

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mental-health-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory

   ```bash
   cd mental-health-analysis
   ```
3. Install required libraries

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the notebook

   ```bash

## 📌 Results & Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **EDA can uncover meaningful mental health insights** from raw data. The findings highlight the importance of workplace support, awareness, and early intervention. The analysis can be further extended by applying **machine learning models** for mental health risk prediction.
